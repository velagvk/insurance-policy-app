## 📞 Support

**If testers report issues:**

1. **Can't access?**
   - Ensure they clicked "Visit Site" on ngrok warning
   - Check URLs still active at http://localhost:4040

2. **Backend errors?**
   - Test health: https://729e38e0ac95.ngrok-free.app/
   - Should return: `{"message":"Insurance Policy API is running"...}`

3. **Seeing fallback/sample data instead of real policies?**
   - **Cause**: Browser cached old JavaScript with wrong API URL
   - **Fix**: Ask them to:
     1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
     2. Clear browser cache and reload
     3. Open in incognito/private browsing mode
   - **Verify**: Open browser console (F12) and check for:
     ```
