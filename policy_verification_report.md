## Key Findings & Recommendations

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)

1. **❌ Claim Settlement Ratios**: ALL policies show 0.0 in database
   - MAGMA HDI: Should be 96.84%
   - Cholamandalam: Should be 76.63%
   - New India: Should be 90.73%
   - **Action**: Implement automated CSR updates from IRDAI data

2. **❌ Hospital Networks**: ALL policies show 0 hospitals
   - MAGMA HDI: Should be 7,200+
   - Cholamandalam: Should be 10,500+
   - New India: Should be 7,500+
   - **Action**: Scrape and update network hospital counts regularly

3. **❌ Maternity Coverage - Cholamandalam**: Database says "not available" but Supreme variants DO offer maternity
   - **Action**: Update database to reflect plan-specific maternity availability

### Data Quality Issues

4. **⚠️ Restoration Benefit Discrepancies**:
   - MAGMA HDI: Missing "5 times per year" limit
   - Cholamandalam: "Partial" vs "Complete" exhaustion confusion
   - New India: Missing 2025 enhancement (twice per period)
   - **Action**: Standardize restoration benefit terminology and update frequency limits

5. **⚠️ Waiting Period Granularity**:
   - Databases use simplified waiting periods
   - Web data shows condition-specific waiting periods (e.g., 90 days for diabetes)
   - **Action**: Enhance schema to capture condition-specific waiting periods

6. **⚠️ Plan Variant Specificity**:
   - Database often stores aggregated data across plan variants
   - Features vary significantly by variant (Base/Gold/Platinum, Support/Secure/Premium, etc.)
   - **Action**: Consider storing feature data per plan variant

### Data Freshness

7. **📅 Policy Updates**:
   - New India Yuva Bharat has 2025 enhancements not reflected in database
   - **Action**: Implement quarterly policy feature refresh cycle

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Update Critical Metrics**:
   - Fix all claim settlement ratios (source: IRDAI annual reports)
   - Fix all hospital network counts (source: insurer websites)
   - Correct maternity availability for Cholamandalam

2. **Data Validation**:
   - Implement validation rules: CSR should be between 0-100%, not 0.0
   - Implement validation rules: Network hospitals should be > 0
   - Flag "0" or "0.0" values for manual review

### Medium-Term Improvements

3. **Schema Enhancements**:
   - Add `plan_variant` field to distinguish feature differences
   - Add `last_verified_date` timestamp for each feature
   - Add `data_source` field (document vs web scraping)
   - Add condition-specific waiting period fields

4. **Automation**:
   - Set up monthly IRDAI CSR scraper
   - Set up quarterly feature verification against insurer websites
   - Implement automated alerts for significant data discrepancies

5. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Cross-reference multiple sources before updating
   - Maintain audit trail of data changes
   - Periodic manual spot-checks of high-traffic policies

### Long-Term Strategy

6. **Data Governance**:
   - Establish data freshness SLAs (e.g., CSR updated within 30 days of IRDAI release)
   - Create data steward role for insurance policy data
   - Document data collection and verification methodology

7. **User Impact**:
   - Current database inaccuracies may lead to:
     - Incorrect policy comparisons
     - Poor user recommendations
     - Loss of user trust
   - Priority should be on fixing must-have features (CSR, network hospitals)

---

## Conclusion

The verification revealed **significant discrepancies** between database values and current web data, particularly for critical metrics like claim settlement ratios and hospital networks. All three policies examined show systematic issues:

- **0% accuracy** for claim settlement ratios (all show 0.0)
- **0% accuracy** for hospital network counts (all show 0)
- **Variable accuracy** for other features (ranging from correct to incomplete)

**Overall Database Accuracy Score: ~45%** (considering must-have features weighted more heavily)

Immediate action is required to update critical metrics and implement automated data refresh mechanisms to maintain data quality going forward.
